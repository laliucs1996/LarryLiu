# My Website
This project is a portfolio website created to host my featured projects, resume and links to my github and linkedin. It uses two packages for certain components, react-bootstrap and react-social-icons for a better look and feel to the navbar. It also uses react-router-dom for routing to each of the tabs in the navbar. Every other component was created using react.js and css.
